# Quinlan_Ghimire_2275Project

Ryan Quinlan and I are going to get a text file with all the words in the dictionary and are gonna use it to compare BST and Trie data structures. Since the words are already ordered in alphabetical order, we will order them by length (if two words are the same length, alphabetical order will take priority) and then put them into the respective structures. Each word is then going to be removed one by one and then runtime analyzed to see which structure is better for searching and removing nodes.
